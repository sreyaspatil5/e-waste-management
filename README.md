# SAWAS - State And Waste Analysis System

SAWAS is an E-waste Management System aimed at providing a technologically efficient and eco-friendly solution to the growing problem of electronic waste management. This project was developed by students of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Walchand Institute of Technology, Solapur, under the guidance of Prof. Anil Chinchwade.

## Abstract

SAWAS aims to bridge the gap between end-users, recycling centers, and manufacturing companies by providing an integrated platform for E-waste management. Through a combination of Android and web applications, along with data science techniques, SAWAS facilitates the efficient collection, analysis, and recycling of electronic waste.

## Key Features

- **End-User Application**: Allows users to issue E-waste collection requests, track their rewards, and access additional support features.
- **Retailer Application**: Enables retailers to manage E-waste collection and delivery to recycling centers.
- **SAWAS Desktop Application**: Utilizes machine learning models for data analysis and visualization to optimize E-waste recycling processes.
- **Open Source Data**: All analyzed data is made available open-source for research and development purposes.

## Problem Statement

With the rapid advancement of technology, effective E-waste management has become a global challenge. India, being one of the largest E-waste producers, faces significant environmental and health risks due to improper disposal. SAWAS aims to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive solution that maximizes E-waste reduction and recycling.

## Objectives

The objectives of SAWAS include developing cross-platform applications for end-users and retailers, implementing machine learning models for data analysis, and promoting transparency in the E-waste management process.

## System Architecture

SAWAS comprises three main components: end-user data collection, data analysis and processing, and E-waste recycling. By integrating these components, SAWAS ensures efficient and eco-friendly management of electronic waste.

## Methodology

SAWAS employs a user-centric approach to E-waste management, leveraging technology to bridge the gap between end-users, manufacturers, and recycling hubs. The State and Waste Analysis System (SAWAS) plays a central role in analyzing E-waste data and recommending appropriate actions for recycling.

## Software and Hardware

- **Android Studio**: Used for building user and retailer applications.
- **Firebase**: Employed as the database system for the project.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Utilized for developing the desktop application.
